        Right now I am not sure what I want to put on this sidebar, but I like the placement of it and I am going to keep it.

        <h1>My Programming experience.</h1>
        <p class="mainbar-p">I first learned to program in 6th grade through the use of two college textbooks, starting on HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
            Once I read those I created a basic website (that looked much worse than this), and on the website I put a game that I made with my brother in law.
            After that I didn't have a project to do or a way to keep up my programming so I went without programming till 9th grade.
        </p>
        <p class="mainbar-p">
            In 9th grade learned C# for my Genius Hour project and created a simple text based rpg, with a few features, but soon after the same problem occured.
            It has only been since my 10th grade year where I have been programming on any kind of regular basics. I took two UVU classes for CS and 
            the classes taught me C# and C++. This is the extent of my experience.
